This repo contains a spotify program I made for myself. I was getting annoyed at having my concentration be shattered constantly by obtrusive ads. The program will detect when spotify is playing an advertisement, and system mute the application until the ad is done with. 

Bundled together into an .exe with PyInstaller - which, unfortunately, seems to use some hacky tricks to get that to work. The program is false positived as an anti-virus as a result.

Made in python. The project began during my high school days and was topped off a bit at the beginning of first year university.
